# Tasks to be done

## SYNOPSIS:
> 1) Literature Survey - 5 papers to be read 
> 2) Abstract
> 3) Introduction
> 4) Methodology 
> 5) Architecture and flow chart

--------------------DONE----------------------------

## IMPLEMENTATION:

**PHASE 1**
> 1) Find out which dataset we are using
> 2) Pre-processing
> 3) Final preprocessed dataset 
> 4) Visualizing the final dataset

**PHASE 2**
> 1) Which ML technique we are using and why
> 2) Building model for detection
> 3) Calculating accuracy of the model
> 4) Testing the entire model

**PHASE 3**
> 1) Analyzing the model and visualizing it
> 2) Plotting various charts and other necessary details

**PHASE 4**
> 1) Testing 
> 2) Fixing bugs and optimization

**PHASE 5** 
> 1) Techniques to make the model work in real-time
> 2) Adding chrome-extension

**Once static model is done we can do this**

###### Additional Elements which can be done if time permits or just for learning purpose:- 
1) Creating a GUI for the entire static model and showing the implementation
2) Embedding it to an existing antivirus software or creating a demo software with this feature
